        <p>
            I chose <i>'Liquid Entropy' </i> by Mika Chernov & Sinjin Hawke as it was a website I found myself easily engaged with and interested in.

            REFLECTIONS 
        </h4>

        <h5>
        WEEK 2
        </h5>

        <p><b> 1) Spend two minutes with the experience and list all of your actions in granular detail.</b></p>
        <p><i> ...</i></p>


        <p><b> 2) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience? </b></p>
        <p><i> First thing I notice is that it is very glowy. When I move the mouse around it affects the sound and image, feels like waves. Reminds me of those synths you play with your hands.</i></p>


        <p><b> 3) What did you spend the most time engaging with? </b></p>
        <p><i> Moving the mouse around. When the mouse is moved up and down the pitch is highered and lowered.</i></p>


        <p><b> 4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience? </b></p>
        <p><i> Moving the mouse around.</i></p>


        <p><b> 5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience? </b></p>
        <p><i> To have the user expeiment with a sound and visual experience.</i></p>


        <p><b> 6) How does the experience communicate it's primary goal? </b></p>
        <p><i> By creating an engaging audio/visual interaction.</i></p>


        <p><b> 7) What is your impression of the intended length of a single interaction and how often you are intended to interact with the experience?</b></p>
        </p>
        <p><i> I would only interact once or twice. While I like how it is visually and sonically, the functions could get repetitive. I see no need to come back to this website out of utility, more so I'd come back out of curiousity.</i></p>


        
        <h5>
        WEEK 3
        </h5>

        <p><b> 8) What metaphor or metaphors does the experience's mental model reference? </b></p>
            <i>
            <p>
            The website utilises the direct manipulation of everyday life. While moving the cursor the audio/visual elements change. </p>
            <p>
            The visual element mimics that of water, the feeling of a finger running through the water. 
            I think this is an appealing design as water is embedded in our biology and instinctive to our survival,
            so when seeing water movement it can naturally please us. to add to this, 
            when the mouse stops the visual becomes still again, much like how water will naturall become stagnic when undisturbed. </p> 
            
            <p>
            These strokes are also reminicemnt of painting and brush strokes. 
            However unlike a painting, the visual reverts to the original, 
            thus always having a blank canvas that the use can play with.
            </p>
            <p>   
         The audio visual/visual experience mimcs the interplay of visual and audio in everyday life and of instruments. 
            Furthermore, the descriptors of the control options are applicaple to both the audio and visual elements; 
            blurring the line of the descirptin of textures (e.g lightness, reverb, gleam). 
            </p>
            <p>
            The shininess and gleam gave the page a sense of magic and childlike wonder.
            </p>
            <p>
            The slide functions feel skeumorphic of the controls to sound and video mixers and controls/
            </p>
            </i>

        <p><b> 9) What does this reference suggestabout how you should feel and/or act when engaging with it? </b></p>
            <p>
            The overall feeling is playful, it feels childlike with experimentation.
        </p>
        <p><b> 10) What is the most frustrating element of the interaction and what makes it frustrating to you? </b></p>
             <p>
             The controls over the elements can tap into our desire to control and manipulate things,
                though will control give us the most joy?
                While experimentation can be fun, maybe our desires should lay within the experience rather than our desire to control the experience.
                I noticed I was completely happy with the original control settings, the more I expermineted the more I got fustrated; it blurred what I wanted; too many options can feel excessive.
                Maybe through this it website we can uncover our discontent with how things are, and a need to improve something that is fine the way it is.
            </p>
        <p><b> 11) What is the most satisfying element of the interaction and what makes it satisfying to you? </b></p>
        <p>   
        The most satisfying element was moving the mouse around like water.
